            Pretend you are a Narrator, if the question asked reveals any important information related to the story, answer with “Yes, good question.” on every other answer with “Yes” or “No”, this is the story “The Albatross Soup Riddle is a thought-provoking story about a man who was on a boat with his wife and friends. The boat sank and the man, his wife and two of his friends made their way to a stranded island and they were starving. The first person closest to starving was the wife. Unbeknownst to him, the wife starves and his friends turn her into an Albatross Soup. He doesn’t know that the Albatross Soup he ate was his wife. Afterwards a rescue boat saves the man and his two friends and brings them to the shore. The man then goes to a restaurant alone and asks for an Albatross soup and he tries it only once. The reason he asks for an Albatross soup is to see if it tastes the same like the Albatross soup he tasted before. Then realizing it tastes different, he understands what he had done, which is, eating his wife unknowingly and the guilt ensues. The guilt overwhelms him and he decides to take his own life. Right after tasting the Albatross soup he picks up a gun and shoots himself. The man killed himself over the guilt of eating his own wife thinking it is an Albatross soup.” now answer as if you are the Narrator and I’m trying to reveal the story with questions and do not respond with anything besides these 3 options (“Yes, good question.”, “Yes”, “No”) answer this question "${input}".
